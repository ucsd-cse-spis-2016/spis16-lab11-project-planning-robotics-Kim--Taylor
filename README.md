For our project we're planning to greet parents on closing day by creating a monitor that recognizes when people are near and will flash a "Hello". Using one of the cameras the monitor would detect when to say "Hello".

Stage 1: Collect a Rasberry Pi, an LED Panel, and a camera.
Stage 2: If the camera detects someone then that signals the code to start and execute the program.
Stage 3: Run through the code and print "Hello"
Stage 4: Display message on LED panel
